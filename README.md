# MWZ Bug Tracker Map for Urzikstan
## Purpose
An interactive map that tracks all discovered map related bugs for the Urzikstan Map on Modern Warfare III Zombies

This project is unoffical and community driven with the purpose of highlighting the various map bugs present on the Ursikstan map for MWZ, this project is in no way affiliated with Call of Duty, its Devlopment team(s) or Publisher.

## How it works
**The image shown below in the next section is the official Urzikstan map made for Modern Warfare Zombies.**

- The map marks all General POIs for clarification, each Coloured Dot Marker also designates a known bug that has been discovered __(See Legend for more details)__

- Each marker can be hovered over to show an image of the issue, its description and any variance or known factors that may / may not cause it to happen.

**Any bug that has been patched will be moved off the map into the patched section to ease confusion.**
